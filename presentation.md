#Hyperbola
##By: Esteban Mu√±oz & Bernardo Oviedo
---
###What is a Hyperbola?
A hyperbola is a curve where the distances of any point from:
  * a fixed point ___(the focus)___, and
  * a fixed straight line ***(the directrix)*** are always in the same ratio.

###Glossary
  1. ***Focus:*** fixed point used to determine the eccentricity of a
hyperbola. 
  2. ***Directrix:*** the line from which the hyperbola curves away from.
  3. ***Eccentricity:*** the amount of variation in the conic section from being circular. 
  4. ***Major Axis:*** a line that passes through the center, vertices and focus of the hyperbola.
  5. ***Minor Axis:*** a line perpendicular to the major axis that passes through the center of the hyperbola.

###Dulles Airport
Dulles Airport is in the
shape of a hyperbolic paraboloid.

###Gear Transmission
Two hyperboloids of revolution can provide gear transmission between two skew axes. 
The cogs of each gear are a set of generating straight lines.

###Cooling Towers of Nuclear Reactors
The hyperboloid is the design standard for all nuclear
cooling towers.
When designing these cooling towers, engineers are faced with two problems:
 1. the structutre must be able to withstand high winds and 
 2. they should be built with as little material as possible.
